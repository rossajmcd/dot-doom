#+title: Doom Emacs configuration
#+author: Ross McDonald
#+email: email@rossputin.me

This is my Doom Emacs configuration. From this org file, all the necessary Doom Emacs config files are generated.

This file is written in [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config][literate programming style]] using [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. See [[file:init.el][init.el]], [[file:packages.el][packages.el]] and [[file:config.el][config.el]] for the generated files.

* References

Shamelessly borrowing from those who came before.

- [[http://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html][Sacha Chua's Emacs Configuration]]
- [[https://tecosaur.github.io/emacs-config/config.html][Tecosaur's Emacs config]]
- [[https://github.com/zzamboni/dot-doom][Zzamboni's Dot Doom]]

Note: I have made my life easy by just using Emacs Doon - it is very fast, very pretty and the config is easier than Spacemacs IMHO.

* Doom config file overview

Doom Emacs uses three config files:

- =init.el= defines which of the existing Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#modules][modules]] are loaded. A Doom module is a bundle of packages, configuration and commands, organized into a unit that can be toggled easily from this file.
- =packages.el= defines which [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#package-management][packages]] should be installed, beyond those that are installed and loaded as part of the enabled modules.
- =config.el= contains all [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configuring-doom][custom configuration]] and code.

There are other files that can be loaded, but these are the main ones. The load order of different files is [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#load-order][defined depending on the type of session]] being started.

All the config files are generated from this Org file, to try and make its meaning as clear as possible. All =package!= declarations are written to =packages.el=, all other LISP code is written to =config.el=.

** Config file headers

We start by simply defining the standard headers used by the three files. These headers come from the initial files generated by =doom install=, and contain either some Emacs-LISP relevant indicators like =lexical-binding=, or instructions about the contents of the file.

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/rossputin/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;;(package! another-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;;(package! this-package
;;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")

;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;;(unpin! t)

;; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY
;; This is a file generated from a literate programing source file located at
;; https://gitlab.com/rossputin/dot-doom/-/blob/master/doom.org
;; You should make any changes there and regenerate it from Emacs org-mode
;; using org-babel-tangle (C-c C-v t)

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!

;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets.
;; (setq user-full-name "John Doe"
;;      user-mail-address "john@doe.com")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;;
;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
;; (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "monospace" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "sans" :size 13))

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
;; (setq org-directory "~/org/")

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
;; (setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; Here are some additional functions/macros that could help you configure Doom:
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

** Customized variables

Doom [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#configure][does not recommend the Emacs =customize= mechanism]]:

#+begin_quote
/Note: do not use M-x customize or the customize API in general. Doom is designed to be configured programmatically from your config.el, which can conflict with Customize’s way of modifying variables./
#+end_quote

All necessary settings are therefore set by hand as part of this configuration file. The only exceptions are "safe variable" and "safe theme" settings, which are automatically saved by Emacs in =custom.el=, but this is OK as they don't conflict with anything else from the config.

* Doom modules

This code is written to the =init.el= to select which modules to load. Written here as-is for now, as it is quite well structured and clear.
